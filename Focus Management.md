## 1. What is Deep Work

### Question 1: What is Deep Work? 

**Answer:**  

“Deep Work” means when you are working on something mentally demanding or creative, with no distractions, fully focused. It’s the kind of work that pushes your skills to their limits and often leads to the most meaningful output.
These are some qualities of deep-work:
- Distraction-free: you block out things like emails, social media, interruptions.
- High cognitive effort: doing things that require thinking, creativity, learning, problem solving, not just routine tasks.


## 2. Optimal duration for deep work

Newport suggests that at least 1 hour is a good minimum block for Deep Work. Sustaining very high concentration is taxing, so there’s usually a limit to how many hours of true “deep” focus one can do in a day without burnout or decline in quality. After some time of deep focus, your ability to concentrate sharply drops. This means the returns drop. So unless you want to work slowly, pushing beyond comfortable focus span becomes less efficient. Usually the first chunk of time is spent getting “into” deep work — settling distractions, getting into mental rhythm. So very short blocks (< 30-45 minutes) may be inefficient since you spend more time warming up than producing.

## 3. Are deadlines good for productivity?

Time-blocking works well together with deadlines. If you block out time for a task, the deadline helps you commit in that block. Deadlines help because they create a sense of urgency, which helps you avoid procrastination. Things tend to get done when there's a deadline. Deadlines can also bring stress, especially if they’re tight, unrealistic, or many of them pile up. It can become overwhelming. Because having limited time, you often cut out unnecessary perfectionism or time-wasting details. Sometimes getting good enough is better than perfect but late.

## 5. Dangers of Social Media


### Question 4: What are the dangers of social media, in brief?  

**Answer:**  
- Social media constantly pulls your attention away. You check something, get interrupted, and it becomes harder to sustain focus on important tasks.
- Because of constant interruptions and the temptation to multitask, tasks that require deep concentration suffer.
- Social media can contribute to anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, and envy. Constant comparison with others, the highlight reels people share, perceived “success” of others — all of that can lead to feeling inadequate or being more anxious.
- When a lot of your free time gets consumed by social media, there’s less time for hobbies, face-to-face interaction, reflection, relaxation.
