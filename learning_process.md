I like the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for a certain amount of time and then taking a rest or doing a fun task that boosts your brain. This will really helpful, and fills energy for the next tasks.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
There is a saying that if you are working, do work. If you are playing, be a player. Doing one task at a time helps to be fully focused on that task. There are two modes of thinking.
    ### Active mode:
        - If you are doing a task, you should apply your full focus to that work.
        - No other work or distractions should be there.
     ### Difuse made:
        - Diffused mode mainly talks about relaxing the brain and the body after work is done.
        - By relaxing our brain, it gains more energy to focus on a particular work.

## What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 
1. Deconstruct the skill.
2. learn Just enough to self-correct
3. Remove Barriers to practice
4. Commit to at Least 20 Hours of Practice

- I will follow the Active and Diffuse mode method to improve focus on a topic.
- Going to apply the topics mentioned in the sources in my learning process.
