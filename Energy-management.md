## 1. Manage Energy not Time

**Question 1:** What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?  

**Answer:**  

For me, the activities that really help me feel calm and relaxed are:
- Listening to soft music.
- Going for a quiet walk, especially in nature.
- Watching a movie or Playing video games.
- Sleeping for a time.
- Practicing deep breathing or just sitting in silence for a while.
- Watching the sunset or simply enjoying a cup of tea.
These small moments slow things down for me and recharge my mind.


**Question 2:** When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?  

**Answer:**  
I usually find myself slipping into the Stress quadrant when I have too many things piled up at once and I’m racing against tight deadlines. It also happens when I’m juggling multiple priorities without a clear plan, or when unexpected problems pop up and I don’t feel fully prepared. Sometimes even overthinking small details puts me there. sometimes  overthinking puts me trouble.



**Question 3:** How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant? 

**Answer:**  
I know I’m in the Excitement quadrant when I feel a rush of energy and genuinely look forward to what I’m doing. If i like anything in doing things I feel Excited. My focus gets sharper, I feel motivated to take on challenges, and even though the task might be demanding, it feels enjoyable rather than draining.
