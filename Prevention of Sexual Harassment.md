# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Introduction

Sexual harassment is any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that violates a person’s dignity or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. It can occur through spoken words, gestures, physical actions, or even digital communication. Such behaviour is not only inappropriate but also against workplace ethics and policies.

### Question 1: What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature. This can be verbal (lewd jokes, inappropriate comments, sexual advances), non-verbal (staring, gestures, displaying offensive content), physical (unwanted touching, blocking someone’s path), or digital (sending explicit messages or images). Even repeated jokes, “harmless” comments, or creating an uncomfortable environment can qualify as harassment if the other person feels unsafe or disrespected. These type of acts comes under sexual harassment.


### Question 2: What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face it, I would first make it clear to the person that their behaviour is unwelcome. If it continues, I would immediately report it to the Internal Committee/PoSH committee as per company policy. If I witness harassment, I would support the affected person, encourage them to speak up, and also report the incident myself. It’s important not to ignore such behaviour, but to follow the official reporting process so the issue is handled fairly and promptly.
